Ai prompts used to make program, each prompt is seperated on a new line and the result of all of these can be sceen in the /src folder:
I'm making the board game Mancala with Java. I am going to provide you with the folder structure as some of my next questions will pertain to it. The folder structure I've chosen to use is 3 top-level folders named config, docs and src respectively and there is also a git ignore file and a build.grade file in this directory. The config folder contains a 'checkstyle' folder which has checkstyle.xml in it. the docs folder has my README.md file. The src has a sub folder 'main' which has another folder in it called 'java'. In this 'java' folder there are 3 folders 'mancala' 'test' and 'ui' each containing various java files. The 'mancala' folder has the following java files; Board.java, GameNotOverException.java, InvalidMoveException.java, MancalaGame.java, NoSuchPlayerException.java, Pit.java, PitNotFound.java, Player.java and Store.java. In the test folder, we have a java folder which has a mancala folder which contains BoradTest.java. Lastly in the UI folder, we have the TextUI.java file which contains the main method for this program

can you display the folder structure so I know if I correctly explained it

Can you write the code for MancalaGame.java? It should include the flowing methods and do not change any of their prototypes: 
+setPlayers(onePlayer: Player, twoPlayer: Player) : : void 
+getPlayers() : : ArrayList
+getCurrentPlayer() : : Player
+setCurrentPlayer(player: Player) : : void 
+setBoard(theBoard: Board) : : void 
+getBoard() :: Board
+getNumStones(pitNum: int) : : int 
+move (startPit: int) :: int 
+getStoreCount (player: Player) : : int 
+getWinner() : : Player 
+isGameOver() : : boolean
+startNewGame() : : void
+toString() : : String

Can you write the code for Board.java? It should include the flowing methods and do not change any of their prototypes: 
+setUpPits() : : void
+getPits() : : ArrayList
+getStores() : : ArrayList 
+setUpStores() : : void
+initializeBoard() : : void 
+resetBoard() : : void
+registerPlayers(one: Player, two: Player) : : void 
+moveStones(startPit: int, player: Player):: int 
+distributeStones(startingPoint: int) : : int 
+captureStones (stoppingPoint: int) :: int 
+getNumStones(pitNum: int) : : int 
+isSideEmpty(pitNum: int) : : boolean

Can you write the code for Player.java? It should include the flowing methods and do not change any of their prototypes: 
+Player()
+Player(name: String)
+getName() : : String
+setName(name: String) : : void 
+setStore(store: Store) :: void 
+getStoreCount() : : int

Can you write the code for Pit.java? It should include the flowing methods and do not change any of their prototypes: 
+getStoneCount() : : int
+addStone() : : void 
+removeStones() : : int

Can you write the code for Store.java? It should include the flowing methods and do not change any of their prototypes: 
+setOwner(player: Player) :: void 
+getOwner() : : Player
+addStones(amount: int) :: void 
+getTotalStones() : : int
+emptyStore() : : int

Can you help me finish the Board.java file based on the flowing decrptions of the metonds:
captureStones should take stones away from the opponents pits
distributeStones Helper method that distributes stones into pits and stores, skipping the opponent's store
getNumStones  Gets the number of stones in a specific pit
getPits Returns the list of pits in the board, not including the stores (note that there should be 12 pits in total they should be numbered 1-6 left to right on the bottom and then above pit number 6 will be pit 7, above pit 5 will be pit 8 etc)
getStores Returns the list of stores in the board, not including the stores
initializeBoard Initializes the board by distributing stones
isSideEmpty Indicates whether one side of the board is empty.
moveStones Moves stones for the player starting from a specific pit.
registerPlayers Connects Players to their Stores
resetBoard Resets the board by redistributing stones but retains the players
setUpPits Establishes 12 empty Pits in the board
setUpStores Establishes 2 empty Stores in the board
toString

Here is the partly completed code you wrote before ask questions if you are unsure about any of the methods:

package mancala;

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Board {
    private ArrayList<Pit> pits;
    private ArrayList<Store> stores;
    private Player playerOne;
    private Player playerTwo;

    public void setUpPits() {
        // Implement logic to set up pits
    }

    public ArrayList<Pit> getPits() {
        return pits;
    }

    public ArrayList<Store> getStores() {
        return stores;
    }

    public void setUpStores() {
        // Implement logic to set up stores
    }

    public void initializeBoard() {
        // Implement logic to initialize the board
    }

    public void resetBoard() {
        // Implement logic to reset the board
    }

    public void registerPlayers(Player one, Player two) {
        playerOne = one;
        playerTwo = two;
    }

    public int moveStones(int startPit, Player player) {
        // Implement logic to move stones
        return 0; // Placeholder, replace with actual implementation
    }

    public int distributeStones(int startingPoint) {
        // Implement logic to distribute stones
        return 0; // Placeholder, replace with actual implementation
    }

    public int captureStones(int stoppingPoint) {
        // Implement logic to capture stones
        return 0; // Placeholder, replace with actual implementation
    }

    public int getNumStones(int pitNum) {
        // Implement logic to get the number of stones in a pit
        return 0; // Placeholder, replace with actual implementation
    }

    public boolean isSideEmpty(int pitNum) {
        // Implement logic to check if a side is empty
        return false; // Placeholder, replace with actual implementation
    }
}


in MancalaGame.java there is a method called getStoreCount, Which is intended to get the total number of stones in a player's store. This method is currently implemented below but does not work can you fix this without adding any additional methods? recall that Store.java also has a getTotalStones method if this is helpful

public int getStoreCount(Player player) {
        return board.getStoreStoneCount(player);
    }

Can you write the code for TextUI.java, this file will have a private member variable of type MancalaGame as well as a member variable of type Scanner. This file handles the user input for the game as well as the printing of all output. It is the class that allows the game to be played. You may make any additional methods required to do this but this file should include the main method for this program and call all the appropriate constructors/methods in the other files    

can you write the code for GameNotOverException.java. This file should appropriately handle all expectations of the type GameNotOverException

can you write the code for InvalidMoveException.java. This file should appropriately handle all expectations of the type InvalidMoveException

can you write the code for NoSuchPlayerException.java. This file should appropriately handle all expectations of the type NoSuchPlayerException

can you write the code for PitNotFoundException.java. This file should appropriately handle all expectations of the type PitNotFoundException

For this method the number of stones to distribute would be the number of stones in the pit. For example if the method is called with a value of 4 then the number of stones to be moved would be the number of stones in pit 4

public int distributeStones(int startingPoint) {
        int stonesToDistribute = 4; // Example: Distribute 4 stones initially
        int currentPit = startingPoint;

        while (stonesToDistribute > 0) {
            pits.get(currentPit).addStone();
            currentPit = (currentPit + 1) % 12; // Move to the next pit in a circular fashion
            stonesToDistribute--;
        }

        // Implement logic to distribute stones, skipping opponent's store
        return currentPit;
    }

the logic to distribute stones, and skipping opponent's store is just to increase the pit number by 1 and if the pit number is 6 the next pit will be the player's store and then pit number 7 after that. If the pit number reaches 12 it loops back around to the first pit. can you write the code to do this?   

can you write a method for my textUI class call public void displayBoard();. This method should use a combination of _ - and | assci charters to display a text based representation of the board game mancala. This mancala game should have 12 pits in total (2 collums and 6 rows) in the middle and 2 stores on each end of the display

Below is the current output of this method, can you adjust it so it will only print 2 and and 6 rows?
